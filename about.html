            <p>"It is a remarkable dichotomy. In many ways, Clark is the most human of us all. Then... he shoots fire from the skies and it is difficult not to think of him as a god. And how fortunate we all are that it does not occur to him. If Clark wanted to, he could use his superspeed and squish me into the cement. But I know how he thinks. Even more than the Kryptonite, he's got one big weakness. Deep down, Clark's essentially a good person.‚Äù -- Batman

            <p>Superman is a Kryptonian with powers that include unrecorded speed, unrivaled power and a genius-level intellect. Superman's struggle and pain are rooted inside of his humanity. Superman's identity as a hero is what pains him, it is the fact that he cannot save everyone which grounds him. Through experience Superman learns that even saving one person if they are in need is more than enough. Superman is not meant to be a god, he can't be aware of every bird or blade of grass. He's a man. He needs to rest, to love, to laugh. He does not have obligations to humankind and it's his dilemma and that burden that he holds every single day. Superman is a product of his environment he isn't a good person because of Krypton or because he has these incredible abilities. If we strip Clark Kent down to his core and remove him of all the powers that he has all of his decisions would be the same. Clark Kent would have the same compassion the same love and he would inspire hope to mankind in the very same way because he was raised by two good people and because his moral compass is so rich and so good. It's ironic that an alien represents the best of humanity. With all of the god-like abilities that Superman has its hard to imagine an alien so powerful coming to Earth choosing to live as a human and protect the Earth rather than to conquer it.

            <p>"Superman began life as baby Kal-El. Born on the distant planet of Krypton. But Superman was actually conceived in the imaginations of two teenage boys from Cleveland, Ohio. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. Both the sons of Jewish immigrants. He was the world's first comic-book superhero. The fearless man with a red cape and an S stretched boldly across his chest. For more than 80 years, Superman has been everything. From a comic book to a cartoon, to a movie star. Some have seen Superman as a mythic symbol of hope, strength and moral certainty. While others would simply call him a pop-culture phenomenon. Throughout his history, he's found himself in touch with the times and occasionally out of fashion. But Superman continues to endure as generation after generation have come to know him. And with each new generation, Superman continues to challenge our collective notion of what it means to be a hero."
